# RecipeBook

RecipeBook is a social platform where foodies and chefs alike can connect to 
create, share, and discover delicious recipes!

## Anonymous Functionality

Browsing the website allows for viewing popular recipes and chefs,
as well as accessing the extensive food lookup tool, allowing people to get
accurate nutritional facts (and view the recipes they appear in)
for hundreds of thousands of food items!

## Authenticated Funcionality

Users can choose on account creation if they will be a Foodie or a Chef!
Foodies can follow chefs, like recipes, add favorite food items, or edit their
profiles! Chefs, in addition to being able to do those things, can create
their own recipes, optionally attaching food data for each ingredient.
